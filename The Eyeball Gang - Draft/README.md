### The Eyeball Gang

For our model we tried multiple approaches but in the end nothing was really
that successful, so here we are presenting you something which is simple to run
 and for us to package/send to you to reduce the chances of us making a mistake.

#### Model description:
We created a simple Linear Regression model which predicts patient Age from the
 image represented as a 3 element vector, where each element is the average
 value of the R,G,or B color channel respectively.

#### Preprocessing:
we take each image and cropped it down to the eye, and then generate the above
mentioned vector from the cropped image.
data was stored in a pandas dataframe with values 'Age', 'R', 'G', 'B'.

#### Model training:
we used sklearn for the linear regresion model and spliting the training / test
 data with a 0.75:0.25(default) split since we believe that for linear regression
 with small number of coefficients, our dataset is big enough.

#### Model evaluation:
how to use:

The code is well documented but essentially you have to load 3 main files into
 your editor (we recomend Spyder):
- main.py,
- data_generator.py
- model_generator.py

We provide the already generated dataset so you don't have to use
 `data_generator.py` to do so. if you want to generate the data yourself, see
 the `data_generator.py` file and then look at the `model_generator.py` file
 after. This will require you to copy all the images into the `images` folder.
If you don't want to generate the data yourself, then just run the `main.py`
 file. We assume you want to evaluate just a single image like in the
 hackathon meeting. So in the project folder (same level as the files i
 previously mentioned) simply drag in the image you want to evaluate and then
 select that image (see main.py). It should run without issue.
